def gpt2_bytes_to_unicode() -> dict[int, str]:
    """
    Returns a mapping between every possible byte (an integer from 0 to 255) to a
    printable unicode string character representation. This function is taken
    from the GPT-2 code.

    For example, `chr(0)` is `\x00`, which is an unprintable character:

    >>> chr(0)
    '\x00'
    >>> print(chr(0))

    As a result, this function returns a dictionary `d` where `d[0]` returns `Ā`.
    The bytes that are visually printable keep their original string representation [1].
    For example, `chr(33)` returns `!`, and so accordingly `d[33]` returns `!`.
    Note in particular that the space character `chr(32)` becomes `d[32]`, which
    returns 'Ġ'.

    For unprintable characters, the function shifts takes the integer representing
    the Unicode code point of that character (returned by the Python `ord`) function
    and shifts it by 256. For example, `ord(" ")` returns `32`, so the the space character
    ' ' is shifted to `256 + 32`. Since `chr(256 + 32)` returns `Ġ`, we use that as the
    string representation of the space.

    This function can simplify the BPE implementation and makes it slightly easier to
    manually inspect the generated merges after they're serialized to a file.
